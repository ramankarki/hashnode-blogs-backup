## Journey for our Personal Growth, Web Development, and Digital Marketing (My first blog)

I said our journey. Because I want to go through this journey with you and leave these footsteps for the upcoming generation who wants to grow as we do.

## Another newbie blogger. 😂😂
Yup, I know that. Don't worry about me. I will get better someday. I promise.😁😁

Anyway,

**Hi everyone! 👋👋**

My name is Raman Karki from Biratnagar, Nepal. I'm an 18 years old high school student pursuing technical education. I have a passion for programming and solving the problem. 

I have been thinking about this for quite some time now. Finally, I think it's time to get into it.

## I'm very excited to start my blogs. Are you too for reading my blogs? 😁😁

**Let me tell you the objective of my blogs, my future blog topics, and my goals.**

*But first, Story time about me. Let's travel back in time.*

I have been an average student and an introvert in all my school time. Therefore, I didn't use to have many friends. I didn't hate school but didn't like it either. I was just doing the things I was told to do by my parents without thinking anything. I was soo dumb. I admit it. 😝😝

## But time will help you grow, Don't worry about that. 😇😇

However, after starting high school, I was bored studying these subjects such as physics, mathematics, chemistry. But I loved computers, mainly software parts. I wanted to be a software developer though I didn't know if it was possible without studying Maths and Physics.

And I didn't want to go to college either because I already gave up on high school. I was just going to school to pass the exams. 😅😅

## So, I started searching on google how to become a software developer.

## What else could I do, right? 😂😂

I found many articles and online courses to guide me through the path to become a software developer.

*I was surprised to see those courses and articles that could teach me to become a software developer cause I never saw anything like that. 😮😮*

I saw many people in youtube videos. They were all learning to code on their own and getting a job at the top tech companies.

## And that's what motivated me to learn to code on my own too. 😁😁

*My only objective was to learn to code and get a job.*

## What else could a lost teenager want, right? 🤔🤔

*By the way, I am still a teenager. 😂😂😂*

By the time I was searching for online courses and programming languages. I found the python programming language to be popular and easy to learn for a beginner. Plus, It had many supporting developer groups that could help me grow faster.

I remember taking some free courses on the python programming language on udemy. I was so happy to learn to code and to solve programming problems also to fix bugs.

But I found that only writing small scripts and just learning to code wasn't enough to be a python developer. You have to build some actual projects to show.

## So, I wanted to build some projects that could be interesting, and I could have fun while making. 🤩🤩

*And, I was using Linux OS cause I found they are better for programming.*

After some time, I decided to build some desktop games. So, I began to learn the pygame library to make some desktop games.

I had a great experience learning the pygame library and building some games like Flappy Bird. It took me some days to figure out how to make that game and to code, but I had fun during the whole time. 😁😁

I also read some books on the python language and solved problems given in those books. I learned about GUI (Graphical User Interface) and wrote some scripts with GUI-based libraries.

## 🕑🕑 A couple of months passed. While I was learning python, I came across hacking.

I found hacking to be more fun and interesting. I watched some youtube videos on hacking and top hackers. Before I knew it, I was already into hacking. So, I started learning some ethical hacking. 

Later, I realized that you should have expertise with UNIX-like OS, networking, scripting, programming language, databases, and web technologies to be a hacker.

It was too much. I know. But, I was trying to learn all those things, literally all of them, because I was having fun. 😂😂

## I was stupid, I know that. 😝😝

However, After a couple of months, I got overwhelmed and realized that I wasn't progressing on anything. 

*Well, that's obviously would have happened if you try to do something like that. 😂😂*

I was confused and spent some time to think what to do. I read some articles, watched youtube videos, and later discovered that,

> "If you will try to learn everything, you will master nothing."

## So finally,

 I decided to stick with one. I found web development more exciting, and it had more job possibilities. I was so motivated to work with other developers in a group. 🥳🥳

And that's what caused me to learn web technologies like Html, CSS, JavaScript. After learning for few months, I began to build some projects like landing pages and games like tic-tac-toe.

## After learning those for a couple of months, 

I began learning React and the Redux library. It helps in building fast and scalable web apps. 

Then, I started to build web apps like a weather app, to-do list, job search, etc.

## I started feeling a bit confident. 😎😎

Later, I wanted to build full-stack apps like a chat app or social media app. So to develop an API for those projects, I needed to learn backend technologies like Nodejs, Express, and MongoDB.

## After learning those technologies and building projects, I began to feel overconfident. 😎😎

*And you know what happens if you get overconfident. 🥴🥴*

I thought that I was ready for a job. So, I started to build a portfolio. I designed my portfolio in Figma and begun building with React and hosted with Netlify.

*I didn't take much time to think about my portfolio and immediately jumped for hunting.*

I looked for jobs in some tech organizations. However, every one of them requested a degree which I didn't have.

## After investing such a lot of time and energy on learning and building yet didn't land any position, 

I was discouraged and didn't know what to do. I tried freelancing on Fiverr. But it felt like it wasn't for me. 😩😩

I wasted 2 - 3 months doing nothing. I wasn't studying at school and wasn't building any projects. I was only watching youtube videos and anime.

*That's how you fall on the ground when you get overconfident. 😂😂*

I got bored and started searching "how to make money online" on YouTube. Most of them were all shi*. 

### How do I know?
Well, I tried all of them. And it didn't work. 😂😂

I wasted so much time searching for shortcuts to make money. But I did learn many things and found some legit long-term ways like Blogging, Digital marketing, Affiliate marketing, selling products and services online, and building own brand.

So, I realized,
> "There is no shortcut for making any progress or money. And if there is, It won't work for the long term."

I also realized that I had many bad habits and a poor mindset that will stop me from meeting my goals. So, I decided to work on it and share my experiences with you and myself in the future.

## And that's what motivated me to start blogging. 💪💪

So, that was my story of how I started programming. And now why I'm going to start blogging.

*I wish I had known about blogging when I was just starting to code. And I dared to actually start to blog. But nothing can change that so, why even bother. 😂😂*

Now back to the previous question,
## Why am I blogging?
-> There is a saying that,
> "The best way to learn anything is to teach others."

That's why I have started blogging to explain whatever I learn by simplifying as much as possible to help you and myself in the future So, that we can grow together. 📈 📈

## What are my future blogs going to be?
-> You should already know the topics of my future blogs after reading all those paragraphs. But anyway, let me tell you again more clearly. 

My upcoming blogs will be on the following topics: Personal growth, Technology, Web Development, web design, Digital marketing, Affiliate marketing, etc.

## What are my goals?
-> I want to be a web developer,

-> Build projects that could solve our problems, 

-> Build a brand, 

-> Be a better person,

-> Share knowledge with others,  😇😇

So, that was my story about how I started programming and the reason to start blogging. I wish to learn, share and grow together who feels the same as me.

Thank you for reading this article. If you have something to share or want me to blog on any topic,
