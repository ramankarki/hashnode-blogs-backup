## Journey to be a Professional Web Developer and Technical Content Writer | Web Developer from Nepal

### Another newbie writer. 😂
Yup, I know that. Don't worry about me. I will get better someday. I promise. Anyway,

**Hi everyone! 👋👋**

My name is Raman Karki from Biratnagar, Nepal. I'm an 18 years old high school student pursuing technical education. I have a passion for programming and solving problems. I have been thinking about this for quite some time now. Finally, I think it's time to get into it.

### I'm really excited to start writing articles. Let me tell you the objective of my articles and my goals.
*But first, Story time about me. Let's travel back in time.*

I have been an average student and an introvert in all my school time. Therefore, I didn't use to have many friends. I didn't hate school but didn't like it either. I was just doing the things I was told to do by my parents without thinking anything. I was soo dumb.

### But time will help us grow.
However, after starting high school, I was bored studying these subjects such as physics, mathematics, chemistry. But I loved computers, mainly software parts. I wanted to be a software developer though I didn't know if it was possible without studying Physics and Chemistry.

And I didn't want to go to college either because I had already given up on high school. I was just passing the school exams.

### So, I started searching on google how to become a software developer.

*What else could I do, right?*

I found many articles and online courses to guide me through the path to becoming a software developer. I was surprised to see those courses and articles that could teach me to become a software developer cause I had never seen such a thing before.

I saw many people on Youtube videos. They were all learning to code on their own and getting a job at the top tech companies.

And that's what motivated me to learn to code on my own too. My only objective was to learn to code and get a job.

### What else could a lost teenager want, right?
*By the way, I am still a teenager.* 😂

By the time I was searching for online courses and programming languages. I found the python programming language to be popular and easy to learn for a beginner. Also, It had many supporting developer groups that could help me grow faster.

I remember taking some free courses on the python programming language on Udemy. I was so happy to learn to code and to solve programming problems also to fix bugs.

But I found that only writing small scripts and learning to code wasn't enough to be a python developer. You have to build some actual projects to show.

### So, I wanted to build some awesome projects while having fun.
I was using Linux OS cause I found they are better for programming. I decided to build some desktop games. So, I began to learn the pygame library to make some desktop games.

I had a great experience learning the pygame library and building some games like Flappy Bird. It took me some days to figure out how to make that game and to code, but I had fun during the whole time.

I also read some books on the python language and solved problems given in those books. I learned about GUI (Graphical User Interface) and wrote some scripts with GUI-based libraries.

### 🕑 A couple of months passed. While I was learning python, I came across hacking.
I found hacking to be more fun and interesting, and I started watching Youtube videos on hacking and top hackers. I was continuously watching hacking videos and reading articles, and Before I knew it, I was already into hacking. So, I started searching for ethical hacking courses and began learning.

Later, I realized that you should have expertise with UNIX-like OS, networking, scripting, programming language, databases, and web technologies to be a hacker. It was too much. I was trying to learn all those things, literally all of them.

### I was stupid, I know that.
However, After a couple of months, I got overwhelmed and realized that I wasn't progressing on anything. I was confused and spent some time thinking about what to do. I read some articles, watched youtube videos, and later discovered that,

> If you will try to learn everything, you will master nothing.

### So finally,
I decided to stick with one. I found web development more exciting, and it had more job possibilities. I was so motivated to work with other developers in a group. 

And that's what caused me to learn web technologies like Html, CSS, JavaScript. After learning for a few months, I began to build projects like landing pages and games like tic-tac-toe.

### After learning those for a couple of months,
I began learning React and the Redux library. It helps in building fast and scalable web apps. Then, I started to build web apps like a weather app, to-do list, job search, etc.

### I started feeling a bit confident. 
Later, I wanted to build full-stack apps like a chat app or social media app. So to develop an API for those projects, I needed to learn backend technologies like Nodejs, Express, and MongoDB.

### After learning those technologies and building projects, I began to feel overconfident. 
*And you know what happens if you get overconfident.* 

I thought that I was ready for a job. So, I started to build a portfolio. I designed my portfolio in Figma and began to build with React and hosted with Netlify. I didn't take much time to think about my portfolio and immediately jumped for hunting. I looked for jobs in some tech organizations. However, every one of them requested a degree which I didn't have.

### After investing such a lot of time and energy on learning and building yet didn't land any position,
I was discouraged and didn't know what to do. I tried freelancing on Fiverr. But it felt like it wasn't for me. I wasted 2 - 3 months doing nothing. I wasn't studying at school and wasn't building any projects. I was only watching youtube videos and anime. I got bored and started searching **"how to make money online"** on YouTube. Most of them were all shi*.

### How do I know?
Well, I tried all of them. And it didn't work. I wasted so much time searching for shortcuts to make money. But I did learn many things and found some legit long-term ways like Blogging, Digital marketing, Affiliate marketing, selling products and services online, and building own brand.

But as I said before, one can't master everything at once. So I decided to stick with one. And that was to be a Web developer and write articles about whatever I learn or know about. AKA Technical content writer.

I realized,

> There is no shortcut for making any progress or money. And if there is, It won't last long.

I also realized that I had many bad habits and a poor mindset which could stop me from meeting my goals. So, I decided to work on it and share my experiences with you and myself in the future. And that's what motivated me to start blogging. I wish I had known about blogging when I had just started to code.

Now back to the previous question,
### Why am I blogging?
There is a saying,

> The best way to learn anything is to teach others.

That's why I have started blogging to explain whatever I learn by simplifying as much as possible to help you and myself in the future so that we can grow together.

### What are my future articles going to be?
My upcoming articles will be about Web development and related fields. I may also share some of my personal experiences. 

### What are my goals?
- To be a web developer and a Technical content writer,
- Build projects that could solve our problems,
- Share knowledge with others, 

So, that was my story about how I started programming and the reason to start blogging and writing articles. I wish to learn, share and grow together who are like me.
